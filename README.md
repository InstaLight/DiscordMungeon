# Discord Mungeon

> A panel for Discord Dungeon

## What is this?

Discord Mungeon is an interactive panel for the popular discord bot, DiscordRPG.

## Why?

I created this because I was sick of copy-pasting commands to progress, and guessing when cooldowns were up.

## What does this offer?

Discord Mungeon provides the following services:

1. Ease of access for basic RPG gameplay, through nice big buttons
2. Programmatic cooldown displays to remove the guesswork
3. It's neat I guess

## Requirements

To use Discord Mungeon, you must be able to access your account's token and be in the [Discord Mungeon guild](http://discord.gg/FDVJuVW).

The latter is to keep all app usage in the same place, so it's easy to spot abuse.

## FAQ

### Are you a DiscordRPG developer?

No, but I can dream.

### Are you affiliated with DiscordRPG?

Not really.

### Does this count as botting?

I'm glad you asked. As you may know, DiscordRPG has a strict no-botting policy. Discord Mungeon does not count as botting, as everything is still done manually. It is intended to help gameplay, not automate it.

### Why do you ask for my token? Are you hacking me?!!!?!

DiscordRPG doesn't provide an API for gameplay, so Discord Mungeon has to send chat messages in order to operate. This requires your user account's token.

Your token is stored to your computer's localstorage, and nowhere else. It never gets sent anywhere. If this still concerns you, I encourage you to review my source code. Stay safe!

### I found a bug, or have a suggestion. Where can I report it?

Please report it in the [Discord Mungeon guild](http://discord.gg/FDVJuVW).
